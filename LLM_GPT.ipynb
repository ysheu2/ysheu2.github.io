    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify patients with potential MASLD by extracting fatty liver findings from unstructured ultrasound reports. I used SQL and regex to retrieve liver-related lines from semi-structured narrative data stored in Oracle (Epic format), and applied the ChatGPT API to classify whether each report indicates steatosis. This approach demonstrates how large language models can be used to structure free-text clinical data for downstream risk identification and care management."

    "This project demonstrates how I used the **ChatGPT API** to extract fatty liver indicators from **unstructured ultrasound reports** to help identify MASLD patients for care management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background: MASLD affects ~25% of adults and can lead to chronic conditions like MASH, cirrhosis, and cardiovascular disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Fatty liver is often missing from structured data. While ultrasound detects it, findings are buried in **semi-structured narrative reports stored in Oracle SQL tables**, following Epic’s standard format. I used **SQL and regex** to isolate liver-related lines and applied **GPT** to classify whether steatosis was present.\n"

    "\n",
    "This project extracts evidence of fatty liver from unstructured ultrasound reports using a multi-step process combining SQL, regex filtering, and the ChatGPT API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Data Extraction**\n",
    "Using SQL, I identified patients who received abdominal ultrasounds based on procedure codes and extracted their corresponding narrative reports, which were stored line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Text Filtering**\n",
    "I applied regular expressions (regex) within SQL to extract only the lines relevant to liver findings. Because the narrative follows a consistent semi-structured format (with lines labeled LIVER: or containing liver-related terms like echogenicity), regex provided a precise and efficient way to isolate the relevant content for further analysis — avoiding unnecessary processing of unrelated sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: LLM Classification**\n",
    "I used the ChatGPT API (GPT-4o-mini) with a structured prompt to determine whether the filtered text indicated fatty liver (steatosis). The model returned a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Validation**\n",
    "I compared model output to physician-reviewed labels and achieved 95% accuracy, demonstrating the reliability of this lightweight, prompt-based NLP method."
