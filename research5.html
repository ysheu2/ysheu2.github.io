								<h3>Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States implemented a coordinator-supported hepatitis B virus (HBV) pathway designed to connect HBV patients with testing, treatment, and ongoing liver cancer monitoring </h3>
								<p> My role was to synthesize and analyze the real-world data, including EHRs, CESR data, and mortality data, to evaluate the performance of the HBV pathway and identifying factors associated with patient's completion of pathway. To this end, we dissected the pathway by steps, then we (1) calculated the completion rate at each step and (2) identified the reasons of why patients left the pathway.  Finally, we conducted statistical tests to compare patient characteristics for those completed versus non-completed the program.  </p>
								<h5>What did we find?...</h5>
										<blockquote> We found an overall 72% completion rate.  Of those who did not complete the pathway, 97% were due to reasons outside of coordinator's control. We found younger age, Asian race, non-hispanic ethnicity, and non-city service areas are associated with higher completion rate.</blockquote>
										</blockquote>
										<h5>What did we learn from these results?...</h5>
												<blockquote>We learned that patients are highly compliant with the coordinator-supported pathway, and that only 3% of the non-completion was associated with coordinator oversight.  The significant lower completion rate at service area C (a city area) warrants further investigation to remove any potential barrier in accessing the care.</blockquote>
